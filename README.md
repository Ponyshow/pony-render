# pony-render

[![Get it on npm](https://nodei.co/npm/pony-render.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/pony-render/)

A fast markdown tokenizer and renderer for creating beautiful HTML presentations.  This is the core rendering engine for [Ponyshow](http://github.com/PonyShow/ponyshow) presentation app and is compatible with the [Shower](https://github.com/shower/shower) HTML presentation library.

Based on Kramed (Aaron O'Mullan) and Marked (Christopher Jeffrey), this rendering engine adds additional tokens for parsing embedded options and rendering logic for creating semantic HTML output.

## Displaying Content

For viewing rendered output, you can use the [ponyshow-web-client](http://github.com/ponyshow/ponyshow-web-client) library or [Shower](https://github.com/shower/shower) framework.  The Ponyshow web client is the main client library for [Ponyshow](http://github.com/PonyShow/ponyshow) and is optimized for `pony-render`.  It includes a forked version of the Shower library, Prism and default CSS files.

## Why?

Creating slides and delivering quality presentations is often a painful process to manage, especially for technical presentations.  While markdown is great for writing content, it is bad for giving presentations.  This project resolves this issue by rendering Markdown into semantically correct HTML that conforms to presentation purposes.  It's also the heart of [Ponyshow](http://github.com/PonyShow/ponyshow).

## Install

``` bash
npm install pony-render --save
```

## Usage

Simple usage:

```js
var Pony = require('pony-render');
console.log(Pony.render('I am using __markdown__.'));
// Outputs: <p>I am using <strong>markdown</strong>.</p>
```
## Syntax Docs

The syntax supports markdown, kramdown and a wide range of additional tokens needed to keep content simple, yet offer flexible rendering. The docs are not yet available, but you can refer to the [Ponyshow Cheet Sheet](https://github.com/Ponyshow/deck-CheatSheet) to get an idea of what's possible.

Official docs are in process.


## Error

### Responses

If a render fails, the response will be an html doc that contains a `rendererror` class that you can style to fit your needs.

**Default output**

```html
<div class='rendererror'>
  <div class='img'></div><br>
  <div class='text'>Rendering error</div>
</div>
```

**Custom HTML**

You can set the `error` property to a custom string on initialization, within a `deck.md` or prior to rendering with a setter function.  This will override the default response structure while rendering.

**Example**

```javascript

// init
Pony.init({"error":"<img src='' />"})

// setter function
setError("<img src='' />");

// in deck.md
error: <img src='' />

```

## API

### Deck Configuration

You can enable capabilities and configuration for a markdown file.  These properties must be defined before any section `---` declaration.

- `theme <string>`: Set the theme name for custom rendering purposes
- `slidenumbers <boolean>`: Hide/show slide numbers. Custom themes can override this. Options: `true`|`false`
- `timing <integer>`: Set any value to automatically advance to the next slide after given time. 
- `footer <string>`: Set a string visible on each slide footer. Custom themes can override this.
- `error <string>`: Set a fail html string that will be displayed as the `innerText` value of the `rendererror` element.
- `tableclass <string>`: Set the class name for a table. Example: `striped`
- `format <string>`: Set either `widescreen` (1920 x 1080) or `standard` (1024 x 768).  Default is `standard`.  It's possible to set a custom format by setting a custom property that specific themes will respond to.  The sets a class name to each slide `<section>`.
- `progress <boolean>`: Show / hide the progress bar. Options: `true`|`false`
- 'build-list': Allows you to step through list bullets one by one to keep your audience focused on what youâ€™re currently talking about.
- 'transition': Change the way slides transition.  Options: `fade` or none. Defaults to none.

### Creating Slides

A new slide is defined by three dashes `---`, typed on a single line, with an empty line above and below.

Slides are rendered as `<section>` HTML nodes.

You can set a `class` or `id` property as part of the triple dash.  Classes do NOT have a dot notation and are included by default.  IDs require a hash symbol.

> Note: It's preferred to use classes for styling since you can have multiple classes defined.  IDs must be unique and are to URL navigation schemes.  Only use IDs if you are sure it will be uniquely referenced.

**Examples**

```

---cover

---section

---#notes

```

This will produce three slides.



### Methods

#### `setHeader(<string> html)`

Sets a prefix string to the final rendering object, after tokens are parsed.

*Returns:* **none**

#### `setFooter(<string> html)`

Sets a postfix string to the final rendering object, after tokens are parsed.

*Returns:* **none**

#### `render(<string> html, <object> properties)`
  
*Returns:* HTML

Tokenizes markdown and parses into HTML.  If a header or footer was set, the strings will be concatenated into a final string response.
